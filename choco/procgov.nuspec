    <summary>This application allows you to put various limits on a Windows process.</summary>
    <description>This application allows you to set constraints on a process, including CPU affinity, rate, committed memory, used physical memory (Working Set) and more. It uses a job object for this purpose.

You may set limits on a newly created process or on an already running one. 

Starting from version 2.8, it is possible to update once set the limits. Simply run procgov providing new limits and the target process ID.

REMEMBER to always use procgov with the same bitness as your application.</description>
